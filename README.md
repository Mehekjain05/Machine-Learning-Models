# Machine-Learning-Models
This repository contains implementations of popular machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Linear Regression. These algorithms are widely used for various tasks, such as classification, regression, and anomaly detection.

To use these algorithms in your own projects, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Mehekjain05/Machine-Learning-Models.git
Import the desired algorithm's module in your Python script or notebook.
Prepare your data by preprocessing and feature engineering as required.
Train the model using your training data.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
